# Snapshot Retrieval Feature Removal Summary

This document summarizes the removal of snapshot retrieval functionality from the MTG Card Pricing Analysis Tool's trend tracker.

## Changes Made

### 🔧 **Services/price_monitor.py**

**Removed Methods:**
- `_get_sets_to_monitor()` - Previously retrieved MTG sets for price monitoring
- `_monitor_set(set_code)` - Previously monitored all cards in a specific set
- `_prepare_card_snapshots(card_data)` - Previously prepared price snapshots for database storage

**Modified Methods:**
- `_run_monitoring_cycle()` - Now only analyzes existing data, no data collection
  - Removed set monitoring loops
  - Removed API calls to collect price data
  - Removed progress tracking for data collection
  - Changed terminal messages from "monitoring cycle" to "analysis cycle"

### 🗄️ **Data/trend_database.py**

**Removed Methods:**
- `record_price_snapshot()` - Previously recorded individual price snapshots
- `record_price_snapshots_batch()` - Previously recorded multiple snapshots efficiently

**Retained Methods:**
- `get_last_price()` - Still needed for trend calculations
- `get_price_history()` - Still needed for trend analysis  
- `find_trending_cards()` - Still needed for trend detection
- `calculate_trend()` - Still needed for trend calculations

### 📊 **What the Trend Tracker Now Does**

#### **Before Removal:**
1. ✅ Collected price data from Scryfall API
2. ✅ Stored price snapshots in database
3. ✅ Analyzed stored data for trends
4. ✅ Generated alerts for significant movements

#### **After Removal:**
1. ❌ ~~Collected price data from Scryfall API~~
2. ❌ ~~Stored price snapshots in database~~
3. ✅ Analyzes existing data for trends
4. ✅ Generates alerts for significant movements

### 🔄 **Workflow Changes**

#### **Old Workflow:**
```
Start Monitoring → Fetch Sets → Get Cards → Record Prices → Analyze Trends → Generate Alerts
```

#### **New Workflow:**
```
Start Analysis → Analyze Existing Data → Generate Alerts
```

### 💾 **Database Impact**

- **Schema Unchanged**: The `price_snapshots` table remains for existing data
- **No New Data**: No new price snapshots will be recorded
- **Analysis Only**: Existing snapshots continue to be analyzed for trends
- **Data Retention**: Old data cleanup still functions normally

### 🎯 **Benefits of Removal**

1. **Faster Execution**: No time spent on API calls and data collection
2. **Reduced API Usage**: No Scryfall API requests during monitoring
3. **Lower System Load**: No background data collection processes
4. **Focus on Analysis**: Pure trend analysis of existing data
5. **No Rate Limiting**: No delays between operations

### 📈 **Retained Functionality**

✅ **Trend Analysis**: Still analyzes existing price data for patterns
✅ **Alert Generation**: Still generates alerts for significant movements  
✅ **Email Notifications**: Still sends email alerts when configured
✅ **Volatility Tracking**: Still uses configurable time windows and thresholds
✅ **Database Cleanup**: Still removes old data according to retention settings
✅ **GUI Integration**: All existing GUI components continue to work

### ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **Existing Data**: Any price snapshots already in the database will continue to be analyzed
2. **No New Data**: The trend tracker will not collect any new price information
3. **External Data Sources**: Users must populate price data from other sources if needed
4. **Analysis Only**: The system is now purely analytical, not data collection

### 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. `/services/price_monitor.py` - Removed data collection methods
2. `/data/trend_database.py` - Removed snapshot recording methods  
3. `/SNAPSHOT_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document (new)

### 🧪 **Testing**

The trend tracker will now:
- Start faster (no data collection delays)
- Complete analysis cycles quickly
- Still generate alerts if existing data shows trends
- Work with any manually imported price data

### 🚀 **Next Steps**

If price data collection is needed in the future:
1. External data import scripts can populate the `price_snapshots` table
2. Manual data entry tools can be developed
3. The removed methods can be restored from version control
4. Alternative data sources can be integrated

The trend analysis engine remains fully functional and will analyze any existing price data in the database.
