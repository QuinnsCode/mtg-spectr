1. ✓ CARD EXISTS IN FIC SET DATA
   - Bane of Progress is present in the FIC set (Final Fantasy Commander)
   - Card data is correctly retrieved from Scryfall API
   - Pricing information is available ($1.30 USD)

2. ✓ PRICING ANOMALY IS REAL
   - FIC printing: $1.30
   - Other printings: $7.05 - $9.74
   - Price difference: 81-87% below market average
   - This represents a significant undervaluation

3. ✗ ANOMALY DETECTION THRESHOLD TOO HIGH
   - Current anomaly score: 0.722
   - Required threshold: 0.8
   - The card fails detection by only 0.078 points
   - This is a borderline case that should be caught

PRICE COMPARISON:
- CC1 (Commander Collection): $9.74 (649% higher than FIC)
- CMA (Commander Anthology): $7.32 (463% higher than FIC)
- C15 (Commander 2015): $7.68 (491% higher than FIC)
- C13 (Commander 2013): $7.05 (442% higher than FIC)
- PLST (The List): $7.64 (488% higher than FIC)
- FIC (Final Fantasy): $1.30 (baseline)

ANOMALY DETECTION BREAKDOWN:
- Current Price: $1.30
- Expected Price: $4.68 (calculated based on rarity, set type, card type)
- Price Deviation: 72.2% below expected
- Anomaly Score: 0.722 (weighted by rarity)
- Threshold: 0.8 (FAILED by 0.078)

WHY THE EXPECTED PRICE IS $4.68:
- Base rare price: $2.00 (Commander set)
- Creature multiplier: 1.3x
- Commander set multiplier: 1.8x
- Final expected: $2.00 × 1.3 × 1.8 = $4.68

PROBLEM: The anomaly detection threshold is set too high at 0.8

IMPACT:
- Cards with 72% price deviation are not flagged
- Only cards with 80%+ deviation are caught
- This misses significant arbitrage opportunities
- The current threshold is too conservative for rare cards

THRESHOLD ANALYSIS:
- Current: 0.8 (catches ~80% deviations)
- Bane of Progress: 0.722 (72% deviation)
- Recommended: 0.7 (catches ~70% deviations)
- Alternative: 0.65 (catches ~65% deviations)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. LOWER ANOMALY THRESHOLD
   - Current: 0.8
   - Recommended: 0.7
   - This would catch Bane of Progress and similar opportunities

2. IMPLEMENT RARITY-BASED THRESHOLDS
   - Mythic: 0.6 (more sensitive)
   - Rare: 0.7 (current case)
   - Uncommon: 0.8
   - Common: 0.9 (less sensitive)

3. ADD MARKET COMPARISON LOGIC
   - Compare FIC prices to other printings
   - Flag cards that are >50% cheaper than similar printings
   - Use historical pricing data when available

CONFIGURATION CHANGES:

File: analysis/set_scanner.py
Line: 98 (anomaly_thresholds)

Current:
    self.anomaly_thresholds = {
        'price_deviation': 0.8,

Recommended:
    self.anomaly_thresholds = {
        'price_deviation': 0.7,  # Lowered from 0.8
        ...
    }

Or implement rarity-based thresholds:
    self.anomaly_thresholds = {
        'mythic_threshold': 0.6,
        'rare_threshold': 0.7,
        'uncommon_threshold': 0.8,

BEFORE IMPLEMENTING:

1. Run analysis on other FIC cards to see impact
2. Test with different threshold values (0.65, 0.7, 0.75)
3. Check for false positives with lower thresholds
4. Validate against known good/bad anomalies

MONITORING:
- Track anomaly detection rates before/after changes
- Monitor precision and recall metrics
- Ensure system doesn't become too noisy

    print("""
The Bane of Progress issue is NOT a data problem - it's a threshold tuning problem.

✓ Data is correct
✓ Calculation is correct  
✓ Logic is correct
✗ Threshold is too conservative

By lowering the anomaly threshold from 0.8 to 0.7, the system would correctly
identify Bane of Progress as undervalued, along with other similar opportunities.

This is a classic precision vs. recall tradeoff - the current system prioritizes
precision (avoiding false positives) over recall (catching all opportunities).
For an arbitrage detection system, slightly higher recall is preferable.
