# Email Notifications Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure email notifications for MTG Card Price Tracker alerts.

## Overview

The email notification system sends price trend alerts to your email address when significant price movements are detected. Email notifications are rate-limited to prevent spam and respect quiet hours.

## Features

- **Automated Alerts**: Receive email notifications for significant price trends
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 1 email per hour to prevent inbox flooding
- **Quiet Hours**: No emails during 10 PM - 8 AM (configurable)
- **Priority-based**: Email content includes alert priority levels
- **Secure**: Uses encrypted credential storage

## Quick Setup

1. **Run the configuration script:**
   ```bash
   python configure_email.py
   ```

2. **Configure your Gmail credentials** (see detailed setup below)

3. **Test the system:**
   ```bash
   python test_email_alert.py
   ```

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Gmail App Passwords

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication:**
   - Go to your Google Account settings
   - Navigate to "Security" â†’ "2-Step Verification"
   - Follow the prompts to enable 2FA

2. **Generate App Password:**
   - In Google Account settings, go to "Security"
   - Click "App passwords" (you need 2FA enabled first)
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (custom name)"
   - Enter "MTG Price Tracker" as the app name
   - Copy the generated 16-character password

### Step 2: Configure Email Settings

You can configure email settings through the GUI or by directly updating the database:

#### Option A: GUI Configuration
1. Open MTG Price Tracker
2. Go to "Trend Tracker" tab
3. Click "Configuration" sub-tab
4. Enable email notifications
5. Enter your Gmail address and app password

#### Option B: Direct Database Configuration
```python
from mtg_card_pricing.services.alert_system import AlertSystem

# Initialize alert system
alert_system = AlertSystem()

# Configure email settings
email_config = {
    'email_enabled': True,
    'email_address': 'your-email@gmail.com',  # Where to send alerts
    'email_username': 'your-gmail@gmail.com',  # Your Gmail address
    'email_password': 'your-app-password',     # 16-character app password
    'email_smtp_server': 'smtp.gmail.com',
    'email_smtp_port': 587,
    'max_emails_per_hour': 1
}

# Update configuration
alert_system.update_config(**email_config)
```

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

Run the test script to verify email functionality:

```bash
python test_email_alert.py
```

This will:
- Test email body creation
- Verify rate limiting works
- Check configuration settings
- Show what would be sent (without actually sending)

## Email Content Format

Email alerts include:

```
Subject: MTG Price Alert: [Card Name]

Body:
MTG Card Price Alert

Card: Lightning Bolt (LEA)
Current Price: $12.50
Price Change: +25.5% (+$2.50)
Alert Priority: HIGH
Time: 2025-07-11 13:30:18

This is an automated alert from your MTG Card Price Tracker.
```

## Configuration Options

### Rate Limiting Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_emails_per_hour` | 1 | Maximum emails sent per hour |
| `quiet_hours_start` | 22 | Start of quiet hours (10 PM) |
| `quiet_hours_end` | 8 | End of quiet hours (8 AM) |
| `min_alert_interval_minutes` | 15 | Minimum time between same card alerts |

### SMTP Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `email_smtp_server` | smtp.gmail.com | SMTP server address |
| `email_smtp_port` | 587 | SMTP port (TLS) |
| `email_username` | (required) | Your Gmail address |
| `email_password` | (required) | Gmail app password |

## Security Considerations

1. **App Passwords**: Never use your regular Gmail password - always use app passwords
2. **Credential Storage**: Passwords are encrypted and stored locally
3. **Local Storage**: All data stays on your machine - no cloud storage
4. **TLS Encryption**: All email communications use TLS encryption

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Email configuration incomplete"**
- Ensure `email_username` and `email_password` are set
- Verify you're using an app password, not your regular password

**2. "Authentication failed"**
- Double-check your app password
- Ensure 2-factor authentication is enabled in Gmail
- Try generating a new app password

**3. "SMTP connection failed"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify SMTP settings (smtp.gmail.com:587)
- Ensure TLS is supported

**4. "No emails received"**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify rate limiting hasn't blocked the email
- Check if you're in quiet hours (10 PM - 8 AM)

### Debug Steps

1. **Check configuration:**
   ```bash
   python test_email_alert.py
   ```

2. **Verify credentials:**
   - Test login to Gmail with your app password
   - Ensure app password hasn't expired

3. **Check logs:**
   - Look for error messages in the application logs
   - Enable debug mode for detailed SMTP logging

## Alternative Email Providers

While this guide focuses on Gmail, you can configure other email providers:

### Outlook/Hotmail
```python
email_config = {
    'email_smtp_server': 'smtp-mail.outlook.com',
    'email_smtp_port': 587,
    # ... other settings
}
```

### Yahoo Mail
```python
email_config = {
    'email_smtp_server': 'smtp.mail.yahoo.com',
    'email_smtp_port': 587,
    # ... other settings
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Dedicated Email**: Consider using a dedicated email account for price alerts
2. **Regular Testing**: Test email functionality monthly to ensure it's working
3. **Monitor Rate Limits**: Adjust thresholds if you receive too many/few emails
4. **Backup Configuration**: Export your settings regularly
5. **Security Updates**: Regenerate app passwords periodically

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check this troubleshooting guide first
2. Run the test script for diagnostics
3. Check application logs for error messages
4. Verify your Gmail settings and app password
